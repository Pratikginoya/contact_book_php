### Contact Book Using PHP

After completion of my CRUD operation learning in php, I have made this Contact book project using simple CRUD operations of PHP.

Description of this project,

- Created user Login and Register pages
- In Log-in page -> User can change his password using Forgot Password option (I have used SMTP mail for this)
- After user login, user can Add his contacts, View his added contacts, Manage his own profile and Log-out his credential
- In Add-Contact page-> User can add his contact or Back to home page
- In View-Contact page -> User can view his all added contacts, Edit this added contacts, Single or Multiple Delete his contacts, Search the name of contacts
- In View-Contact page -> I have created pagination also
- In Manage-Profile page -> User can View or Edit his profile details, Change his current password

This is my first project using PHP
