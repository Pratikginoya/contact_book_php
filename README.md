After completion of my CRUD operation learning in php, I have made this Contact book project using simple CRUD operations of PHP.

Description of this project,

Created user Login and Register pages
In Log-in page -> User can change his password using Forgot Password option (I have used SMTP mail for this)
After user login, user can Add his contacts, View his added contacts, Manage his own profile and Log-out his credential
In Add-Contact page-> User can add his contact or Back to home page
In View-Contact page -> User can view his all added contacts, Edit this added contacts, Single or Multiple Delete his contacts, Search the name of contacts
In View-Contact page -> I have created pagination also
In Manage-Profile page -> User can View or Edit his profile details, Change his current password

This is my first project using PHP
